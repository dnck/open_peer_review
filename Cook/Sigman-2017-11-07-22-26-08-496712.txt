<p> Dear Dr. Sigman, <br/>
<br/>
My name is Dan Cook. I'm seeking peer reviewers for the article, "Test Article". Will you consider reviewing it? <br/><br/>

For your convienence, I've included the article the meta-data at the bottom of the email.<br/><br/>

Before you make up your mind, consider that (1) your peer review will be publically available on the article's homepage page <br/>
and (2) we will assign your peer review a citable DOI, which technically makes it a part of your own publication record.<br/> 

Still interested in reviewing? <br/><br/>

If so, please note that you will only be able to review the article if you have more than 5 or more published articles listed on your ORCID profile.<br/>
This is one way in which we control the quality of peer reviews at ScienceOpen. However, if you do not have 5 publications and you want to conduct a peer review<br/>
e.g. because you are a PhD student working on a closely related topic, an early career researcher with publications in preparation, etc., <br/>
then please let me know and we can work out a way for your contribution to appear as a peer review. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Finally, if needed, I can help create your accounts with ScienceOpen.com and (and possibly) ORCID.org. Just let me know that you need assistance. <br/>

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to your response. <br/><br/>

Best Wishes,<br/>
Dan Cook <br/>
